# Phase 1: Foundation & Lab Setup
# Index: [3]
#
# This module is the most critical dependency for the data factory. It abstracts all
# interactions with the remote lab environment (the Windows VMs and the Splunk instance).
# All connections and credentials should be managed here to ensure a clean separation
# of concerns.
#
# REQUIREMENTS (per v1.3 blueprint):
# 1. Must handle connection credentials securely (e.g., via environment variables or a config file, NOT hardcoded).
# 2. Must provide a function to execute commands on the remote Victim Workstation.
# 3. Must provide a function to query the local Splunk instance for log data.
# 4. Must include robust error handling for connection failures, authentication issues, and query timeouts.

# --- Unit Test Stub (for `tests/test_lab_connection.py`) ---
# The corresponding test file should:
# 1. Mock the `winrm` and `splunklib` libraries to avoid making real network calls.
# 2. Have a test that calls `run_remote_powershell` and asserts that the mock
#    session's `run_ps` method was called with the correct command.
# 3. Have a test that calls `query_splunk` and asserts that the mock service's
#    `jobs.create` method was called with the correct SPL query.
# 4. For a true integration test (run manually), it would attempt to connect
#    and run a simple command like `hostname` and a basic search like `search index=* | head 1`.
