# Phase 2: Data Factory - Curation Tooling
# Index: [9]
#
# This file contains the integration tests that measure the accuracy of the
# entire curation pipeline against the expert-defined ground truth.
#
# REQUIREMENTS (per v1.3 blueprint):
# 1. It must load the `expert_ground_truth.json` as the "perfect" answers.
# 2. Recommender Accuracy Test:
#    - For each primitive in the ground truth, it simulates the automated curation process.
#    - It calls the `recommendation_engine` and `rule_formatter`.
#    - It compares the *automatically generated* rules against the expert rules and calculates an F1-score.
# 3. Metadata Accuracy Test:
#    - This is simpler. It compares the `intent` and `mitre_ttps` from the developer's
#      main `primitives_library.json` against the `expert_ground_truth.json` to check for consistency.
