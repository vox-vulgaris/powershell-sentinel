# Phase 4: Model Training & Evaluation
# Index: [14c]
#
# Part 3 of the Prompt Engineering experiment. This script evaluates the three
# models trained in the previous step against a held-out test set and
# declares a winner based on performance metrics.

# TODO: This script will be a simplified version of the main `evaluate.py`.
# 1. It will loop through each of the three trained prompt models.
# 2. For each model, it will run inference on a small, dedicated test set (e.g., 50 pairs).
# 3. It will calculate key metrics, especially "JSON Parse Success Rate" and F1-score.
# 4. It will print a clean comparison table showing the results for each prompt.
# 5. The prompt that yields the highest overall score (especially on parsing) is the winner.
